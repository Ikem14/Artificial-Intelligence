# Artificial-Intelligence project by Ikem Okafo and Josh Moyer
GOAL OF PROJECT WAS TO CREATE AN AGENT THAT LEARNS DURING THE FRIST RUN AND THAT BECOMES MORE EFFICIENT DURING THE SECOND RUN.
DecisionFactory(#) shows our progress.
DecisionFactory3Change is the last file we worked on.
When running Framework3Change, the first option to run in an empty room is designed to show that the agent's first movements isn't random. Therefore the second run breaks. However it runs smoothly in other environments
